# 🧭 **1. What is Jupyter Notebook?**

> Jupyter Notebook is an **open-source, interactive environment**
> where you can write code, add text, visualize data, and document your workflow — all in one place.

It supports **40+ languages** including:

* 🐍 **Python** (main one for data science)
* 📊 **R**
* 📈 **Julia**

You can:

* Write and run code **cell by cell**
* Add **charts, markdown, formulas, and images**
* Create **shareable, reproducible reports**

> 💡 *Think of it as your “data lab notebook” — part code editor, part report builder.*

## ⚡ **2. Why Use Jupyter Notebook?**

### 🧩 **Interactive Computing**

You can **run code instantly** and see the results — ideal for testing ideas and debugging.

### 🔁 **Reproducibility**

Each notebook saves:

* The **code**
* The **output**
* The **reasoning text**

So anyone can **re-run and understand** your entire workflow later.

### 🔗 **Integration**

Jupyter integrates seamlessly with:

* **Python data libraries** (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
* **Machine learning** (Scikit-learn, TensorFlow)
* **Cloud and AI tools**

> 🧠 *It’s the global standard tool used by data scientists, researchers, and analysts.*

## 🧰 **3. Setting Up Jupyter Notebook**

In your **course lab**, setup is automatic — no installation needed.

But for your **own computer**, you can install it in two ways 👇

---

### 🪜 **Option 1: Install with Python + Pip**

1. **Install Python**
   → Download from [python.org](https://www.python.org)
2. **Install Jupyter Notebook**
   Run in terminal or command prompt:

   ```bash
   pip install notebook
   ```
3. **Launch Jupyter**

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

   It will open automatically in your web browser ([http://localhost:8888](http://localhost:8888)).

> ✅ *Recommended for users who already have Python installed.*

---

### 🧩 **Option 2: Install with Anaconda**

1. **Download & Install Anaconda**
   → From [anaconda.com](https://www.anaconda.com)
2. **Install Notebook via Conda**

   ```bash
   conda install -c conda-forge notebook
   ```
3. **Launch Notebook**

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

> 💡 *Anaconda is preferred for beginners — it installs Python, Jupyter, and 100+ libraries together.*
